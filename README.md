## Posology Text Binary Classification Using RCNN model based on transformers

## Notes

Clone the project on your machine with :

```
git clone https://github.com/zakariamejdoul/ml_tech_test.git
```

The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that our models depends on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Behaviour

Text classification, including supervised text clas-sification, semi-supervised text classification, and unsu-pervised text classification, is a major research field inNatural language processing (NLP).
n this study, wefocus on the supervised learning area; that is, we trainthe model on labeled data and test it using unlabeleddata. Text classification has three main fields: sentimentanalysis[2], question type classification[3]and topic typelabeling[4]. Text classification can be applied in many realapplications such as spam classification, news grouping,intelligent recommendation.
